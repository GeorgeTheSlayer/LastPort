## Description

- Created an embedded system using C++, CAD software, soldering, breadboarding, and 3D printing within one year.
- Used a STM32H750 microcontroller to create a fast, real-time audio synthesizer with multiple modes and algorithms.
- Created a RTOS that handled a button matrix, potentiometers, and pogo pins to ensure uninterrupted interaction.
