## Abstract

This paper discusses the use of AI and web browsers for live musical performance. The purpose of this project was to allow developers to more easily include these tools into their workflow using modern day web tools. This project used [Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#dom-baseaudiocontext-onstatechange), [Device Orientation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/deviceorientation_event), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [ESModules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/). The demonstration site was made with [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). By doing so, the project is more accessible to the public.
